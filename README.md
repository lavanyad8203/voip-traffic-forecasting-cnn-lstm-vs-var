# voip-traffic-forecasting-cnn-lstm-vs-var
This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach using CNN-LSTM to forecast VoIP traffic metrics such as MOS, Jitter, Delay, and more. The model's performance is compared against a traditional statistical methodâ€”Vector Autoregression (VAR). The dataset includes 600,000+ real-time VoIP packets collected under mobility scenarios to evaluate QoS and QoE indicators.

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
